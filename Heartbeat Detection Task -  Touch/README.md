# Self Other Touch Task (SOTT)

Welcome to the Heartbeat Detection (HBD) Task - Touch folder! This task contains resources and instructions for conducting the Heartbeat Detection Task - Touch version, a classic interoceptive task used in research and clinical settings.

## Overview

This is a task with three conditions: stroke the own arm, stroke a pillow or be stroked by the experimenter (Boehme et al. 2019). 
It allows you to look at electrophysiological differences during self-touch, other-touch, and object touch. 


## Task Description

Participants are asked to stroke their left arm with the right hand using slow, soft movements. They are asked to perform the same touch on the pillow (control condition). During the other-touch condition the experimenter strokes the participantâ€™s left arm in the same manner. This task can be performed with/without EEG recording (select option in the script). Each condition will be performed for three minutes. You can add markers pressing Z on keyboard. This task can be counterbalanced, you can select order of conditions. If script is edited, it is possible to change duration of conditions or times of repetition of each. 

## Usage

Feel free to use the materials provided in this repository to conduct the Self Other Touch Task (HBD) in your research or clinical practice. The task instructions, stimuli, and data collection procedures are available for customization and adaptation to your specific needs.

## Materials

- **Task Instructions**: Included in task and available for costumization
- **Stimulus Presentation**: You will require psychtoolbox to be added to your matlab path in order to run this task.
- **Data Collection Forms**: A "log".mat structure will be created with various indexes including condition order, timestamps, EEG events, etc. The structure will be named after the subject code (introduced in pop-up before start).
