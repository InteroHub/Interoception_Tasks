# Interoception Tasks Repository

Welcome to the Interoception Tasks Repository! This repository contains a collection of tasks and resources related to interoception research. Tasks within this repository have been used in numerous papers.

## Overview

Interoception refers to the sense of the internal state of the body. This repository aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a curated set of tasks and materials to assess and explore interoceptive abilities.

## Tasks
### Heart-related:
1. **Heartbeat Detection Task**: A classic interoceptive task where participants are asked pay attention to own and other heartbeats (attention task) and tap along with heartbeats (behavioral task). (can be performed with EEG/ECG - Matlab Version)
2. **Self Other Touch Task**: A self/other touch task in where participants are asked to touch their selves (an object as control) or receive touch from experimenter while measuring electrophysiology (Matlab Version). 

## Usage

Feel free to use, modify, and adapt these tasks for your research or clinical purposes. The tasks are provided with instructions and can be easily integrated into experimental setups.
Tasks within the repository may include EEG / iEEG related code for specific channel amount EEGs.
Tasks might require psychtoolbox installed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have additional interoception tasks, datasets, or improvements to existing materials, please submit a pull request.
